# DiffGaussianRasterizer
My reimplementation of the differentiable rasterizer of 3D Gaussian Splatting in C++ and CUDA.

## TODO

- [ ] Forward pass
- [ ] Backward pass
  - [ ] Analytical Gradient as original Gaussian Splatting
  - [ ] Analytical Gradient for depth regularization
  - [ ] Analytical Gradient for camera pose optimization
- [ ] Unit Test
- [ ] Pytorch Binding
